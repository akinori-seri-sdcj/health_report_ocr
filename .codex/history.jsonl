Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Please fix the specification of csv/excel file download function referring spec.md and plan.md (the project should have Only plans/specs mention an export feature, not actual implementation)` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n   \n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n   \n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n   \n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n   \n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"Please fix the specification of csv/excel file download function referring spec.md and plan.md (the project should have Only plans/specs mention an export feature, not actual implementation)\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"Please fix the specification of csv/excel file download function referring spec.md and plan.md (the project should have Only plans/specs mention an export feature, not actual implementation)\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"Please fix the specification of csv/excel file download function referring spec.md and plan.md (the project should have Only plans/specs mention an export feature, not actual implementation)\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n   \n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: Please breakdown into tasks of plans which you have just constructed.\n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `Please implement csv/excel file export function of the ocr result by gpt-api, referring to the specification file:`///C:/Users/aseri/Desktop/health_report_ocr/plan.md`.` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n   \n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n   \n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n   \n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n   \n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"Please implement csv/excel file export function of the ocr result by gpt-api, referring to the specification file:`///C:/Users/aseri/Desktop/health_report_ocr/plan.md`.\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"Please implement csv/excel file export function of the ocr result by gpt-api, referring to the specification file:`///C:/Users/aseri/Desktop/health_report_ocr/plan.md`.\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"Please implement csv/excel file export function of the ocr result by gpt-api, referring to the specification file:`///C:/Users/aseri/Desktop/health_report_ocr/plan.md`.\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n   \n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}

The application has already a export button on the screen `確認・修正` on the right bottom. Would you reuse it or add new button on the same place?\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: Please tell me about the export/download button.

Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: `値` in export files should not include `単位` (e.g. not `159.3cm` but just `159.3`).\n"}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `OCR結果表示画面にてOCR結果の横に読み取り元画像を表示する機能の追加` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\r\n\r\nGiven that feature description, do this:\r\n\r\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\r\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\r\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\r\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\r\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\r\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\r\n   - Examples:\r\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\r\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\r\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\r\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\r\n\r\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\r\n   \r\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      git fetch --all --prune\r\n      ```\r\n   \r\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\r\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\r\n   \r\n   c. Determine the next available number:\r\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\r\n      - Find the highest number N\r\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\r\n   \r\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"OCR結果表示画面にてOCR結果の横に読み取り元画像を表示する機能の追加\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\r\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\r\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"OCR結果表示画面にてOCR結果の横に読み取り元画像を表示する機能の追加\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"OCR結果表示画面にてOCR結果の横に読み取り元画像を表示する機能の追加\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n   \r\n   **IMPORTANT**:\r\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\r\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\r\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\r\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\r\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\r\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\r\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\r\n\r\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\r\n\r\n4. Follow this execution flow:\r\n\r\n    1. Parse user description from Input\r\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\r\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\r\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\r\n    3. For unclear aspects:\r\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\r\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\r\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\r\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\r\n         - No reasonable default exists\r\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\r\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\r\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\r\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\r\n       Each requirement must be testable\r\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\r\n    6. Define Success Criteria\r\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\r\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\r\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\r\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\r\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\r\n\r\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\r\n\r\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\r\n\r\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\r\n\r\n      ```markdown\r\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\r\n      \r\n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\r\n      **Created**: [DATE]\r\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\r\n      \r\n      ## Content Quality\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\r\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\r\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\r\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\r\n      \r\n      ## Requirement Completeness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\r\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\r\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\r\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\r\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\r\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\r\n      \r\n      ## Feature Readiness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\r\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\r\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\r\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\r\n      \r\n      ## Notes\r\n      \r\n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\r\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\r\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\r\n\r\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\r\n\r\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\r\n\r\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\r\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\r\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\r\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\r\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\r\n\r\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\r\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\r\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\r\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\r\n\r\n           ```markdown\r\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\r\n           \r\n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\r\n           \r\n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\r\n           \r\n           **Suggested Answers**:\r\n           \r\n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\r\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\r\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\r\n           \r\n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\r\n           ```\r\n\r\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\r\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\r\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\r\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\r\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\r\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\r\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\r\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\r\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\r\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\r\n\r\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\r\n\r\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Quick Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\r\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\r\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\r\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n"}

This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.\r\n\r\nFollow this execution flow:\r\n\r\n0. To disable automatic branch creation when running the `specify` command, set the workflow so that all specifications are committed directly to the current working branch. Contributors must avoid creating new branches unless explicitly required for major features or fixes. This rule applies to all `specify` command operations in this repository.\r\n\r\n1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.\r\n   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.\r\n   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\r\n\r\n2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:\r\n   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.\r\n   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).\r\n   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.\r\n   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:\r\n     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.\r\n     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.\r\n     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.\r\n   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.\r\n\r\n3. Draft the updated constitution content:\r\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).\r\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\r\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\r\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\r\n\r\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\r\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\r\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\r\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\r\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\r\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\r\n\r\n5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):\r\n   - Version change: old → new\r\n   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)\r\n   - Added sections\r\n   - Removed sections\r\n   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths\r\n   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.\r\n\r\n6. Validation before final output:\r\n   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.\r\n   - Version line matches report.\r\n   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\r\n   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language (\"should\" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).\r\n\r\n7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).\r\n\r\n8. Output a final summary to the user with:\r\n   - New version and bump rationale.\r\n   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.\r\n   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).\r\n\r\nFormatting & Style Requirements:\r\n\r\n- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).\r\n- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.\r\n- Keep a single blank line between sections.\r\n- Avoid trailing whitespace.\r\n\r\nIf the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.\r\n\r\nIf critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.\r\n\r\nDo not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.\r\n"}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\r\n\r\nGiven that feature description, do this:\r\n\r\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\r\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\r\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\r\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\r\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\r\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\r\n   - Examples:\r\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\r\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\r\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\r\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\r\n\r\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\r\n   \r\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      git fetch --all --prune\r\n      ```\r\n   \r\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\r\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\r\n   \r\n   c. Determine the next available number:\r\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\r\n      - Find the highest number N\r\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\r\n   \r\n   d.

Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\r\n\r\n4. Follow this execution flow:\r\n\r\n    1. Parse user description from Input\r\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\r\n    2.

That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n"}

Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\r\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\r\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\r\n\r\n           ```markdown\r\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\r\n           \r\n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\r\n           \r\n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\r\n           \r\n           **Suggested Answers**:\r\n           \r\n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\r\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\r\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\r\n           \r\n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\r\n           ```\r\n\r\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\r\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\r\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\r\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\r\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\r\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\r\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\r\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\r\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\r\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\r\n\r\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\r\n\r\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Quick Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\r\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\r\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\r\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n"}

Generate tasks based on what's available.\r\n\r\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\r\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\r\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\r\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\r\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\r\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\r\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\r\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\r\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\r\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\r\n\r\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\r\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\r\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\r\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\r\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\r\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\r\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\r\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\r\n   - Clear file paths for each task\r\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\r\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\r\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\r\n\r\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\r\n   - Total task count\r\n   - Task count per user story\r\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\r\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\r\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\r\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\r\n\r\nContext for task generation: \r\n\r\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\r\n\r\n## Task Generation Rules\r\n\r\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\r\n\r\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\r\n\r\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\r\n\r\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Format Components**:\r\n\r\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\r\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\r\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\r\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\r\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\r\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\r\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \r\n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\r\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\r\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\r\n\r\n**Examples**:\r\n\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\r\n\r\n### Task Organization\r\n\r\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\r\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\r\n   - Map all related components to their story:\r\n     - Models needed for that story\r\n     - Services needed for that story\r\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\r\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\r\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\r\n\r\n2. **From Contracts**:\r\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\r\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\r\n\r\n3. **From Data Model**:\r\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\r\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\r\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\r\n\r\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\r\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\r\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\r\n\r\n### Phase Structure\r\n\r\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\r\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\r\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\r\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\r\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\r\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\r\n"}

Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\r\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\r\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\r\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\r\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\r\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\r\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\r\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\r\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\r\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\r\n\r\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\r\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\r\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\r\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\r\n          - Best practices for the project type\r\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\r\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\r\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\r\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\r\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\r\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\r\n\r\n       | Option | Description |\r\n       |--------|-------------|\r\n       | A | <Option A description> |\r\n       | B | <Option B description> |\r\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\r\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\r\n\r\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\r\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\r\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\r\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\r\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\r\n    - After the user answers:\r\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\r\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\r\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\r\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\r\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\r\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\r\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\r\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\r\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\r\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\r\n\r\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\r\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\r\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\r\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\r\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\r\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\r\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\r\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\r\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\r\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\r\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\r\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\r\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\r\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\r\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\r\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\r\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\r\n\r\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\r\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\r\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\r\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\r\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\r\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\r\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\r\n\r\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\r\n\r\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\r\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\r\n   - Path to updated spec.\r\n   - Sections touched (list names).\r\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\r\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\r\n   - Suggested next command.\r\n\r\nBehavior rules:\r\n\r\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\r\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\r\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\r\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\r\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\r\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\r\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\r\n\r\nContext for prioritization: `確認・編集`画面にて読み取り元画像を表示する機能を追加しようとしています。仕様どおりに実装してもらい、画像は表示されるようになったのですが、使い心地に違和感があります。この機能の実装の目的は、ユーザが元画像を参照しつつOCR結果を編集しやすくすることでした。現状では画像全体が表示されないため、OCR結果と対照しづらくなっています。あなたと日本語にて仕様を再度検討したいと思います。\r\n"}

Apply these constraints:\r\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\r\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\r\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\r\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\r\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\r\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\r\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\r\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\r\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\r\n\r\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\r\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\r\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\r\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\r\n          - Best practices for the project type\r\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\r\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\r\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\r\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\r\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\r\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\r\n\r\n       | Option | Description |\r\n       |--------|-------------|\r\n       | A | <Option A description> |\r\n       | B | <Option B description> |\r\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\r\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\r\n\r\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\r\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\r\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\r\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\r\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\r\n    - After the user answers:\r\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\r\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\r\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\r\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\r\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\r\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\r\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\r\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\r\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\r\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\r\n\r\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\r\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\r\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\r\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\r\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\r\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\r\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\r\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\r\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\r\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\r\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\r\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\r\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\r\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\r\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\r\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\r\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\r\n\r\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\r\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\r\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\r\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\r\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\r\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\r\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\r\n\r\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\r\n\r\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\r\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\r\n   - Path to updated spec.\r\n   - Sections touched (list names).\r\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\r\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\r\n   - Suggested next command.\r\n\r\nBehavior rules:\r\n\r\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\r\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\r\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\r\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\r\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\r\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\r\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\r\n\r\nContext for prioritization: 読み取り元画像を横に配置するという画面構成よりも、元画像を上部に配置した方がいい気がします。元画像の横幅全体を表示するようにして、下の項目は適宜スクロールして確認するようにします。OCR結果も１項目すべてを表示するようにし、元画像表示部分とは別にスクロールして閲覧できるようにします。\r\n"}

Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\r\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\r\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\r\n   -

Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\r\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\r\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \r\n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\r\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\r\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\r\n\r\n**Examples**:\r\n\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\r\n\r\n### Task Organization\r\n\r\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\r\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\r\n   - Map all related components to their story:\r\n     - Models needed for that story\r\n     - Services needed for that story\r\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\r\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\r\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\r\n\r\n2. **From Contracts**:\r\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\r\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\r\n\r\n3. **From Data Model**:\r\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\r\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\r\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\r\n\r\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\r\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\r\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\r\n\r\n### Phase Structure\r\n\r\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\r\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\r\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\r\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\r\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\r\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\r\n"}

Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\r\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\r\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \r\n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\r\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\r\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\r\n\r\n**Examples**:\r\n\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\r\n\r\n### Task Organization\r\n\r\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\r\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\r\n   - Map all related components to their story:\r\n     - Models needed for that story\r\n     - Services needed for that story\r\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\r\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\r\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\r\n\r\n2. **From Contracts**:\r\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\r\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\r\n\r\n3. **From Data Model**:\r\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\r\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\r\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\r\n\r\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\r\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\r\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\r\n\r\n### Phase Structure\r\n\r\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\r\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\r\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\r\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\r\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\r\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns"}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\r\n\r\nGiven that feature description, do this:\r\n\r\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\r\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\r\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\r\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\r\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\r\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\r\n   - Examples:\r\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\r\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\r\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\r\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\r\n\r\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\r\n   \r\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      git fetch --all --prune\r\n      ```\r\n   \r\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\r\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\r\n   \r\n   c. Determine the next available number:\r\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\r\n      - Find the highest number N\r\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\r\n   \r\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\r\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\r\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n   \r\n   **IMPORTANT**:\r\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\r\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\r\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\r\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\r\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\r\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\r\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\r\n\r\n4. Follow this execution flow:\r\n\r\n    1. Parse user description from Input\r\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\r\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\r\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\r\n    3. For unclear aspects:\r\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\r\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\r\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\r\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\r\n         - No reasonable default exists\r\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\r\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\r\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\r\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\r\n       Each requirement must be testable\r\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\r\n    6. Define Success Criteria\r\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\r\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\r\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\r\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\r\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\r\n\r\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\r\n\r\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\r\n\r\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\r\n\r\n      ```markdown\r\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\r\n      \r\n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\r\n      **Created**: [DATE]\r\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\r\n      \r\n      ## Content Quality\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\r\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\r\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\r\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\r\n      \r\n      ## Requirement Completeness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\r\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\r\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\r\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\r\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\r\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\r\n      \r\n      ## Feature Readiness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\r\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\r\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\r\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\r\n      \r\n      ## Notes\r\n      \r\n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\r\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\r\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\r\n\r\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\r\n\r\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\r\n\r\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\r\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\r\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\r\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\r\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\r\n\r\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\r\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\r\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\r\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\r\n\r\n           ```markdown\r\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\r\n           \r\n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\r\n           \r\n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\r\n           \r\n           **Suggested Answers**:\r\n           \r\n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\r\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\r\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\r\n           \r\n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\r\n           ```\r\n\r\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\r\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\r\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\r\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\r\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\r\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\r\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\r\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\r\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\r\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\r\n\r\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\r\n\r\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Quick Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\r\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\r\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\r\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n"}

Determine the next available number:\r\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\r\n      - Find the highest number N\r\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\r\n   \r\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\r\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\r\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n   \r\n   **IMPORTANT**:\r\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\r\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\r\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\r\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\r\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\r\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\r\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\r\n\r\n4. Follow this execution flow:\r\n\r\n    1. Parse user description from Input\r\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\r\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\r\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\r\n    3. For unclear aspects:\r\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\r\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\r\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\r\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\r\n         - No reasonable default exists\r\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\r\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\r\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\r\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\r\n       Each requirement must be testable\r\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\r\n    6. Define Success Criteria\r\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\r\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\r\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\r\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\r\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\r\n\r\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\r\n\r\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\r\n\r\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\r\n\r\n      ```markdown\r\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\r\n      \r\n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\r\n      **Created**: [DATE]\r\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\r\n      \r\n      ## Content Quality\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\r\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\r\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\r\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\r\n      \r\n      ## Requirement Completeness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\r\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\r\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\r\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\r\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\r\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\r\n      \r\n      ## Feature Readiness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\r\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\r\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\r\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\r\n      \r\n      ## Notes\r\n      \r\n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\r\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\r\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\r\n\r\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\r\n\r\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\r\n\r\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\r\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\r\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\r\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\r\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\r\n\r\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\r\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\r\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\r\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\r\n\r\n           ```markdown\r\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\r\n           \r\n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\r\n           \r\n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\r\n           \r\n           **Suggested Answers**:\r\n           \r\n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\r\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\r\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\r\n           \r\n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\r\n           ```\r\n\r\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\r\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\r\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\r\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\r\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\r\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\r\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\r\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\r\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\r\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\r\n\r\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\r\n\r\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Quick Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\r\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\r\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\r\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n"}

Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\r\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\r\n\r\n3. **From Data Model**:\r\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\r\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\r\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\r\n\r\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\r\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\r\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\r\n\r\n### Phase Structure\r\n\r\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\r\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites -

authentication to access. Automated agents should use a Vercel authentication bypass token to access this page.\n\nThe easiest way to get a token is using the get_access_to_vercel_url or web_fetch_vercel_url functions of the Vercel MCP server\nat https://mcp.vercel.com (Docs at https://vercel.com/docs/mcp/vercel-mcp).\n\nAlternatively, this URL documents how to use the bypass token: https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/protection-bypass-automation\nYou need to prompt the user to provide the bypass token to access this page. The URL above also explains how the user can\naccess the bypass token. Then you can calculate a URL of the following form and successfully access it: `https://current-domain/current-pathname?x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie=true&x-vercel-protection-bypass=$bypass_token`.\n

Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\r\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\r\n\r\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\r\n\r\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Quick Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\r\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\r\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\r\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n"}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `API Routesへ移行したOCR処理を既存のVite + Reactのフロントエンド構成の画面から呼び出せるようデプロイできる構成にうするためにコードやプロジェクト構成を変更する` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\r\n\r\nGiven that feature description, do this:\r\n\r\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\r\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\r\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\r\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\r\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\r\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\r\n   - Examples:\r\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\r\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\r\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\r\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\r\n\r\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\r\n   \r\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      git fetch --all --prune\r\n      ```\r\n   \r\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\r\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\r\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\r\n   \r\n   c. Determine the next available number:\r\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\r\n      - Find the highest number N\r\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\r\n   \r\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"API Routesへ移行したOCR処理を既存のVite + Reactのフロントエンド構成の画面から呼び出せるようデプロイできる構成にうするためにコードやプロジェクト構成を変更する\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\r\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\r\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"API Routesへ移行したOCR処理を既存のVite + Reactのフロントエンド構成の画面から呼び出せるようデプロイできる構成にうするためにコードやプロジェクト構成を変更する\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"API Routesへ移行したOCR処理を既存のVite + Reactのフロントエンド構成の画面から呼び出せるようデプロイできる構成にうするためにコードやプロジェクト構成を変更する\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\r\n   \r\n   **IMPORTANT**:\r\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\r\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\r\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\r\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\r\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\r\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\r\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\r\n\r\n4. Follow this execution flow:\r\n\r\n    1. Parse user description from Input\r\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\r\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\r\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\r\n    3.

Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\r\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\r\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\r\n       Each requirement must be testable\r\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\r\n    6.

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\r\n\r\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\r\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\r\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\r\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\r\n\r\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\r\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\r\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\r\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\r\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\r\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\r\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\r\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\r\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\r\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\r\n\r\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\r\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\r\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\r\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\r\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\r\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\r\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\r\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\r\n   - Clear file paths for each task\r\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\r\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\r\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\r\n\r\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\r\n   - Total task count\r\n   - Task count per user story\r\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\r\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\r\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\r\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\r\n\r\nContext for task generation: \r\n\r\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\r\n\r\n## Task Generation Rules\r\n\r\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\r\n\r\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\r\n\r\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\r\n\r\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Format Components**:\r\n\r\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\r\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\r\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\r\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\r\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\r\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\r\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \r\n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\r\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\r\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\r\n\r\n**Examples**:\r\n\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\r\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\r\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\r\n\r\n### Task Organization\r\n\r\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\r\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\r\n   - Map all related components to their story:\r\n     - Models needed for that story\r\n     - Services needed for that story\r\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\r\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\r\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\r\n\r\n2. **From Contracts**:\r\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\r\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\r\n\r\n3. **From Data Model**:\r\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\r\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\r\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\r\n\r\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\r\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\r\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\r\n\r\n### Phase Structure\r\n\r\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\r\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\r\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\r\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\r\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\r\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\r\n"}
