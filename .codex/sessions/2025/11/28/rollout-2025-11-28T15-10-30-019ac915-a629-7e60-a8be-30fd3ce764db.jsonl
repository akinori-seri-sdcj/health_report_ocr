Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\r\n\r\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\r\n\r\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\r\n\r\n      ```markdown\r\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\r\n      \r\n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\r\n      **Created**: [DATE]\r\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\r\n      \r\n      ## Content Quality\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\r\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\r\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\r\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\r\n      \r\n      ## Requirement Completeness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\r\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\r\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\r\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\r\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\r\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\r\n      \r\n      ## Feature Readiness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\r\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\r\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\r\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\r\n      \r\n      ## Notes\r\n      \r\n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\r\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\r\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\r\n\r\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\r\n\r\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\r\n\r\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\r\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\r\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\r\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\r\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\r\n\r\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\r\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\r\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\r\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\r\n\r\n           ```markdown\r\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\r\n           \r\n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\r\n           \r\n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\r\n           \r\n           **Suggested Answers**:\r\n           \r\n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\r\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\r\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\r\n           \r\n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\r\n           ```\r\n\r\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\r\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\r\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\r\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\r\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\r\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\r\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\r\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\r\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\r\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\r\n\r\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\r\n\r\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Quick Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\r\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\r\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\r\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n"}]}}

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\r\n\r\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\r\n\r\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\r\n\r\n      ```markdown\r\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\r\n      \r\n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\r\n      **Created**: [DATE]\r\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\r\n      \r\n      ## Content Quality\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\r\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\r\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\r\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\r\n      \r\n      ## Requirement Completeness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\r\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\r\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\r\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\r\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\r\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\r\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\r\n      \r\n      ## Feature Readiness\r\n      \r\n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\r\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\r\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\r\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\r\n      \r\n      ## Notes\r\n      \r\n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\r\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\r\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\r\n\r\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\r\n\r\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\r\n\r\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\r\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\r\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\r\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\r\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\r\n\r\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\r\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\r\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\r\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\r\n\r\n           ```markdown\r\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\r\n           \r\n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\r\n           \r\n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\r\n           \r\n           **Suggested Answers**:\r\n           \r\n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\r\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\r\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\r\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\r\n           \r\n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\r\n           ```\r\n\r\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\r\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\r\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\r\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\r\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\r\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\r\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\r\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\r\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\r\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\r\n\r\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\r\n\r\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Quick Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\r\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\r\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\r\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\r\n\r\n### Section Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\r\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\r\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\r\n\r\n### For AI Generation\r\n\r\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\r\n\r\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\r\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\r\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\r\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\r\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\r\n   - Lack any reasonable default\r\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\r\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\r\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\r\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\r\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\r\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\r\n\r\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\r\n\r\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\r\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\r\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\r\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\r\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\r\n\r\nSuccess criteria must be:\r\n\r\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\r\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\r\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\r\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\r\n\r\n**Good examples**:\r\n\r\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\r\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\r\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\r\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\r\n\r\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\r\n\r\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\r\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\r\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\r\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\r\n","images":[]}}
